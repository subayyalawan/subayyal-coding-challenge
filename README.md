# Sample User Project By Subayyal Ayub

Smaple user is a Coding Challenge Project that was given to me by Brave BPO. It is use to show list of users in the form of cards. You can search for user by using their name in the search bar. You can also apply filter for male or female to get data accordingly. 

I'm fetching the data from [RandomUser](https://randomuser.me/) api. You can also view the live app [here](https://subayyal-coding-challenge.vercel.app/) 

I created this site using Vite, Reactjs, TailwindCss and other libraries listed below.
## Installation

Clone the repository and then follow the steps

```bash
  cd project_name
  npm i
```

after the installation is completed and node_modules have successfully created.
Get Google Maps api key from [Google](https://console.cloud.google.com/).


### Environment Variables

create an .env file in the root directory with following code:

`VITE_RANDOM_USERS_BASE_URL ="https://randomuser.me/api/"`

`VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "Your Google Maps Api Key"`




after creating the .env file, you can run the npm command
